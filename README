USING
-----

Ledger's xml output is ill-formed xml at the moment.

Use "./led2xml filename.led" to generate clean xml. 


WEB SERVER
----------

Uses python and wsgi.

You probably want easy_install if you don't have it:

   wget http://peak.telecommunity.com/dist/ez_setup.py
   python ez_setup.py

Then:

   easy_install Paste PasteDeploy PasteScript
   cp demain.paste.in demain.paste
   
   # (edit host/port in demain.paste if you want)
   
   paster demain.paste
